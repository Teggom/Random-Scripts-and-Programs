Back when Selinium was supported by R, this script could break the online game Skribble.io

The goal of the game was one person would get a word and start drawing it, everyone else would start guessing. More points were awarded the faster you got it. 

The script broke the website because it sent too many requests as it tried every permutation possible for however many blanks were provided :(
